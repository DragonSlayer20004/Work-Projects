Semester 3 at Otterbein university course COMP 2100 Computer Systems

Short Course Description:
Introduction to fundamental data structures and computing algorithms within an object-oriented context.
Principles of data abstraction and representation are examined. Additional topics include specification,
design, use, and implementation of abstractions; recursion; and intuitive analysis of algorithms.

There are 7 assignments and 4 projects total. All labs and projects are done in Java. (Assignment 2, 3, 5, 6 wasn't code based and thus not included)

Assignment1: Recreate the List Java class and test using unit tests. Included List methods are: newList, add, addAll, clear, contains, get, indexOf, isEmpty, lastIndexOf, remove, set, size.
Assignment4: Recreate the HashTable Java class and test using unit tests. Include HashTable methods are: hash, step, nextPrime, isPrime, containsKey, put, get.
Assignment7: Perform several sorts and compute how long they took. Sorts methods included are: Quick Sort, Merge Sort, Heap Sort, Radix Sort.

DSProject1: Read in a bitmap and make adjustments to the file based on inputted commands. Commands are: invert, grayScale, blur, verticallyFlip, shrink, enlarge, rotate, medianFilter, horizontallyMirror.
DSProject2: Read in mathmatical equations and give out the appropiate answer according to PEMDAS. Example: (20/(10)+3)
DSProject3: Use a red black tree to read in words with a rating of how good or bad the word is.
DSProject4: Read in a graph and answer questions about it. Methods included are: isConnected, minimumSpanningTree, shortestPath, isMetric, makeMetric, travelingSalesmanProblem, approximateTSP.
