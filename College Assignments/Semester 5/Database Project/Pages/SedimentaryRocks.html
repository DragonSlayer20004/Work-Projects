                <p class="infoText"><strong>Sedimentary rocks</strong> are formed by the accumulation of sediments. There are three basic types of sedimentary rocks.</p>    
                <p class="infoText"><strong>Clastic sedimentary rocks</strong> form from the accumulation and lithification of mechanical weathering debris. Examples include: breccia, conglomerate, sandstone, siltstone, and shale. </p>
                <p class="infoText"><strong>Chemical sedimentary rocks</strong> form when dissolved materials preciptate from solution. Examples include: chert, some dolomites, flint, iron ore, limestones, and rock salt.</p>
                <p class="infoText"><strong>Organic sedimentary rocks</strong> form from the accumulation of plant or animal debris. Examples include: chalk, coal, diatomite, some dolomites, and some limestones.</p>

                    <p class="infoText">Chalk, soft, fine-grained, easily pulverized, white-to-grayish variety of limestone. Chalk is composed of the shells of such minute marine organisms as foraminifera, coccoliths, and rhabdoliths. The purest varieties contain up to 99 percent calcium carbonate in the form of the mineral calcite. The sponge spicules, diatom and radiolarian tests (shells), detrital grains of quartz, and chert nodules (flint) found in chalk contribute small amounts of silica to its composition. Small proportions of clay minerals, glauconite, and calcium phosphate also are present.</p>

                    <p class="infoText">Chert is a sedimentary rock composed of microcrystalline or cryptocrystalline quartz, the mineral form of silicon dioxide (SiO2). It occurs as nodules, concretionary masses, and as layered deposits. Chert breaks with a conchoidal fracture, often producing very sharp edges. Early people took advantage of how chert breaks and used it to fashion cutting tools and weapons. "Chert" and "flint" are names used for the same material. Both are varieties of chalcedony.</p>

                    <p class="infoText">Breccia is a term most often used for clastic sedimentary rocks that are composed of large angular fragments (over two millimeters in diameter). The spaces between the large angular fragments are filled with a matrix of smaller particles and a mineral cement that binds the rock together.</p>

                    <p class="infoText">Coal is an organic sedimentary rock that forms from the accumulation and preservation of plant materials, usually in a swamp environment. Coal is a combustible rock and, along with oil and natural gas, it is one of the three most important fossil fuels. Coal has a wide range of uses; the most important use is for the generation of electricity.</p>

                    <p class="infoText">Dolomite is a common rock-forming mineral. It is a calcium magnesium carbonate with a chemical composition of CaMg(CO3)2. It is the primary component of the sedimentary rock known as dolostone and the metamorphic rock known as dolomitic marble. Limestone that contains some dolomite is known as dolomitic limestone. Dolomite is rarely found in modern sedimentary environments, but dolostones are very common in the rock record. They can be geographically extensive and hundreds to thousands of feet thick. Most rocks that are rich in dolomite were originally deposited as calcium carbonate muds that were postdepositionally altered by magnesium-rich pore water to form dolomite.</p>

                    <p class="infoText">Conglomerate is a clastic sedimentary rock made up of rounded clasts that are greater than two millimeters in diameter. The spaces between the clasts are generally filled with sand- and clay-size particles. The rock is bound together by a cement that is usually composed of calcite or quartz.</p>

                    <p class="infoText">Diatomite is a friable light-colored sedimentary rock that is mainly composed of the siliceous skeletal remains of diatoms. It is a very porous rock with a fine particle size and a low specific gravity. These properties make it useful as a filter media, an absorbent, and as a lightweight filler for rubber, paint, and plastics. When diatomite is crushed into a powder, it is usually called "diatomaceous earth," or D.E.</p>

                    <img id="" src="../Media/Images/sedimentaryRock.3.jpg" alt="Flint">
                    <p class="infoText">Flint is a hard, tough chemical or biochemical sedimentary rock that breaks with a conchoidal fracture. It is a form of microcrystalline quartz that is typically called "chert" by geologists. Flint often forms as nodules in sedimentary rocks such as chalk and marine limestones. The nodules can be dispersed randomly throughout the rock unit but are often concentrated in distinct layers. Some rock units form through the accumulation of siliceous skeletal material. These can recrystallize to form a layer of bedded flint.</p>

                    <p class="infoText">Sandstone is a sedimentary rock composed of sand-size grains of mineral, rock, or organic material. It also contains a cementing material that binds the sand grains together and may contain a matrix of silt- or clay-size particles that occupy the spaces between the sand grains. Sandstone is one of the most common types of sedimentary rock, and it is found in sedimentary basins throughout the world. Deposits of sand that eventually form sandstone are delivered to the basin by rivers, but may also be delivered by the action of waves or wind. Some sand grains might be organic particles, such as sand and shell debris produced within the basin.</p>
